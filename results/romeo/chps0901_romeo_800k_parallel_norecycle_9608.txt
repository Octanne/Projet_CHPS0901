slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 9608 ON romeo-c022 CANCELLED AT 2025-03-27T19:06:36 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[47379,0],0] on node romeo-c022
  Remote daemon: [[47379,0],2] on node romeo-c024

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
