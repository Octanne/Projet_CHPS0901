slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 9252 ON romeo-c026 CANCELLED AT 2025-03-27T13:34:46 ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[32906,0],0] on node romeo-c026
  Remote daemon: [[32906,0],1] on node romeo-c027

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
