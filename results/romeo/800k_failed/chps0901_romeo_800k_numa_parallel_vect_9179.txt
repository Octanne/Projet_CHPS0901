slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 9179 ON romeo-c027 CANCELLED AT 2025-03-26T03:21:58 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[55304,0],0] on node romeo-c027
  Remote daemon: [[55304,0],1] on node romeo-c028

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
