slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 9622 ON romeo-c031 CANCELLED AT 2025-03-27T22:00:40 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[23028,0],0] on node romeo-c031
  Remote daemon: [[23028,0],1] on node romeo-c032

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
